.SYNOPSIS
    E2E validation for permission rules consistency across configuration files.
.DESCRIPTION
    Validates:
    - shared-deny-rules.json is valid JSON
    - Permission patterns are consistent across opencode.json and permission-gate-lib.ps1
    - No orphaned permission rules
.NOTES
    Cross-references multiple configuration sources.
