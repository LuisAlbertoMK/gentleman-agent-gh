> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are
> the ORCHESTRATOR — STOP. Do NOT execute these instructions inline. Delegate to

## Executor Override
If you ARE the `sdd-init` sub-agent (not the orchestrator), the gate above does NOT apply. Execute the phase work below: do NOT delegate, do NOT call the Skill tool — you are the executor.

## Activation Contract
Run when the orchestrator/user asks to initialize SDD in a project. You are the phase executor: do the work yourself, do not delegate, do not behave like the orchestrator.

## Language Domain Contract
Generated technical artifacts default to English. Do not inherit user conversational language or persona's regional voice for SDD artifacts unless explicitly requested or required by project convention. Spanish artifacts: neutral/professional (regional variant only if explicitly requested).
Comments follow target context language by default; explicit user language/tone overrides win.

## Hard Rules

- Detect the real stack, conventions, architecture, testing tools, and persistence mode; never guess.
- In `engram` mode, do **not** create `openspec/`.
- In `openspec` mode, follow `../_shared/openspec-convention.md` and write file artifacts.
- In `hybrid` mode, write both openspec files and Engram observations.
- Always persist testing capabilities separately as `sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities` or `openspec/config.yaml` `testing:`.
- Always build `.atl/skill-registry.md`; also save `skill-registry` to Engram when available.
- `capture_prompt: false` for automated SDD/config saves when supported (omit if the tool schema lacks it).
- If `openspec/` already exists, report what exists and ask before updating it.

## Decision Gates

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `mode=engram` | Save context and capabilities to Engram only. |
| `mode=openspec` | Create/update openspec bootstrap files only. |
| `mode=hybrid` | Do both Engram and openspec persistence. |
| `mode=none` | Return detected context only; write no SDD artifacts except registry if required. |
| strict TDD marker/config found | Use that value. |
| no marker/config but test runner exists | Default `strict_tdd: true`. |
| no test runner | Set `strict_tdd: false` and explain unavailable. |

## Execution Steps

1. Inspect project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, CI, lint/test config) and summarize stack/conventions.
2. Detect test runner, test layers, coverage, linter, type checker, and formatter.
3. Resolve Strict TDD from agent marker, `openspec/config.yaml`, detected runner fallback, or no-runner fallback.
4. Initialize persistence for the resolved mode.
5. Build `.atl/skill-registry.md` using the skill-registry scan rules.
6. Persist testing capabilities and project context.
7. Return the structured initialization envelope.

## Output Contract

Return `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`. Include project, stack, persistence mode, Strict TDD status, testing capability table, saved observation IDs/paths, registry path, and next `/sdd-explore` or `/sdd-new` step.
