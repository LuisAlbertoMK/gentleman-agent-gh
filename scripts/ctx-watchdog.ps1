.SYNOPSIS
    Context-window watchdog — monitors context usage and recommends
    Recursive Summary Compression (L1/L2/L3) based on usage zone.

.DESCRIPTION
    Implements the Context-Window Protection protocol from the skill-graph:

    Zone thresholds (percentage of context window used):
      GREEN  (0–40%)  — Normal operation, no compression needed
      YELLOW (40–60%) — Conserve context, summarize completed outputs
      ORANGE (60–80%) — Light compression (L1), trim passive context
      RED    (80–100%)— Aggressive compression (L2/L3), prepare for session end

    Compression levels:
      L1 — Light:      Summarize completed tool outputs, keep active context
      L2 — Medium:     Recursive summary of completed sections, trim buffers
      L3 — Heavy:      Maximum compression, retain only critical instructions

    Call after each major reasoning round. Use ctx_stats MCP tool to get
    current usage, then pass it here for a zone recommendation.

.PARAMETER UsagePercent
    Current context usage as a percentage (0-100).

.PARAMETER UsedBytes
    Current bytes consumed (alternative to UsagePercent).

.PARAMETER TotalBytes
    Total context window size in bytes. Required if UsedBytes is provided.

.PARAMETER Json
    Emit machine-readable JSON.
